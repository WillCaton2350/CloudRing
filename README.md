# CloudRing
Idea for a cloud service company named CloudRing that offers cloud security, 5TB of storage, with a store and sync feature. You could also share files and collaborate on projects using CloudRing.
There would be different monthly plans to retain access to CloudRing (CloudRing Lite, CloudRing Plus, and CloudRing Pro)
The company would also offer training on how to use the different CloudRing services via Webinars and Quick Tips.
I have also created an about page with dummy data that explains the company's mission statement, origins, and information about who would be the CEO and founders of CloudRing.
I also created a static contact page with CloudRing's Location, phone number, and support email.
This is a project in process, written in HTML and CSS.
